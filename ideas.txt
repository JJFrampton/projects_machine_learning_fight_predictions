# ideas

try to find factors that contribute to fights ending in the first round
  - location, fighting styles, etc

## pulling data from wiki
import pandas as ps
jones = pd.read_html('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Jones')
print(jones[0])
print(jones[1])
print(jones[2])

could use something like
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_UFC_fighters
to get a list of fighters to loop through
